# startup-script
Python morning startup script that opens the websites I use throughout the day and shows my calendar events.

This is a very simple script to open up important websites and show my calendar schedule for the day at any point in time.

To use, head over to https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python and generate your credentials.json to authorize.

Then run the script with 
 `python startup.py`
 
 Optionally, run the shell file (not yet uploaded). This will automatically run the script.
